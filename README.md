This is an attempt at archiving programs written at NIELIT, Calicut during the ED500: PG Diploma in Embedded System Design program,  Batch - August '19 

GPIO_LED_CMSIS 
  - LEDs are made to toggle with a software delay
  
GPIO_LED_Key_CMSIS
  - LEDs are made to toggle at the press of a switch

GPIO_LED_KEY_EXTI_CMSIS
  - LEDs are made to toggle at the press of a switch with the use of external interrupts
  
TIMER_CMSIS
  - LEDs are made to toggle at certain intervals using timers

TIMER_INT_CMSIS
  - LEDs are made to toggle at certain intervals using timers and it's associated interrupts
  
USART_TX_CMSIS
  - Data is transmitted using UART 
  
USART_TX_TIM-INT_CMSIS
  - Data is transmitted at certain intervals using timers and it's asccociated interrupts
